# BloodHound Custom Queries
Custom Query list for the Bloodhound GUI based off my cheatsheet

Replace the .json file located in C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\BloodHound\customqueries.json with this one, or open up your file (click on the pencil icon next to Custom Queries in the Queries tab) and copy+paste in my contents, Then refresh Bloodhound (Queries tab>Custom Queries>Refresh icon).

Note: It's possible to merge queries from this project with others by using  [bqm](https://github.com/Acceis/bqm) (Bloodhound Query Merger) that deduplicates custom BloudHound queries from different datasets (actually 12) and merge them in one customqueries.json file.
